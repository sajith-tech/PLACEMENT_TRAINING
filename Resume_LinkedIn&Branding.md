## 📝 Resume Building (Cybersecurity Focus)
A resume should highlight **skills, projects, and achievements** clearly.  

### ✅ Resume Do’s:
- Keep it **1–2 pages only**.  
- Use **action verbs**: implemented, secured, investigated, analyzed, optimized.  
- Tailor resume to **specific job roles** (SOC Analyst, Pentester, Forensic Analyst).  
- Highlight **cybersecurity certifications** (CEH, OSCP, CHFI, CompTIA Security+).  
- Showcase **hands-on projects**:
  - “Performed penetration testing on a simulated web app using Burp Suite.”  
  - “Analyzed network traffic using Wireshark to detect anomalies.”  
- Include **GitHub or blog links** for credibility.  

### ❌ Resume Don’ts:
- Avoid large paragraphs → use bullet points.  
- Don’t include unnecessary personal details (religion, photo, marital status).  
- Don’t list skills you can’t explain in interviews.  

### 📂 Suggested Resume Sections:
1. **Contact Info** – Name, Email, LinkedIn, GitHub.  
2. **Professional Summary** – 2–3 lines on your goals & skills.  
3. **Skills** – Tools, technologies, programming languages.  
4. **Projects** – Hands-on cybersecurity projects, labs, CTFs.

## 🌐 LinkedIn Optimization
A LinkedIn profile is your **digital resume + portfolio**. Recruiters check it before interviews.  

### ✅ Steps to Optimize:

2. **Headline** – Example:  
   - “Cybersecurity Enthusiast | SOC Analyst Trainee | Red Team Learner”  
   - “Aspiring Penetration Tester | OSCP Student | Security Researcher”  
3. **About Section** (short story format):  
   - Who you are → What you’ve done → What you’re learning → What you want.  
   - Example:  
     *“Cybersecurity student with hands-on experience in penetration testing, network analysis, and incident response. Skilled in tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite. Actively learning OSCP labs and contributing to CTF write-ups. Interested in SOC Analyst and Red Team roles.”*  
4. **Featured Section** – Add GitHub, blog posts, or project links.  
5. **Experience** – Internships, volunteering, freelance, lab projects.  
6. **Skills & Endorsements** – List tools, technologies, frameworks.  
7. **Engagement** – Post about cybersecurity news, writeups, labs → build visibility.
